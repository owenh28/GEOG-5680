## My first report
A first example of generating a report using R, RStudio and **knitr**.
The goal of this report is to:

- Generate a simple report
- Include some R code
- Include a figure generated by R
```{r}
5+6
```
```{r}
# Read file and display summary
giss <- read.csv("giss_temp.csv")
summary(giss)
```
```{r}
# Get a mean annual temp and get list of years in the dataset
annualTemp = tapply(giss$TempAnom, giss$Year, mean)
years = unique(giss$Year)
```
## Plot section
First, a histogram showing the distribution of all temperature anomaly values.
Second, a plot of annual temperature change.
```{r}
hist(giss$TempAnom, breaks = 20)
```
```{r}
plot(years, annualTemp, type = 'l', lwd = 2, col = 2,
     xlab = "Years", ylab = "Temp Anom")
abline(h=0, lty=2)
```
